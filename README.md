# smartLedController
Controll your leds from every device connected at your home's network.
You need an Arduino, an ethernet shield and a custom pcb with 2 (depends how many channels you want) voltage regulators.

You might need to change the IP and/or the mac adress at .ino file.
Upload the .ino file to your arduino using the Arduino IDE.
